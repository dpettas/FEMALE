# FEMALE

This is the first attempt to write a C++ for finite element method.

## TODO LIST

g++ -I./include main.cpp ./source/LinearAlgebra/DenseMatrixSolver.cpp  ./source/BasisFunctions/Phi.cpp  -llapack

compile: g++ -I./include main.cpp ./source/LinearAlgebra/DenseMatrixSolver.cpp  -llapack
create unit tests for each class
